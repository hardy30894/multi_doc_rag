"Which two key ways do both Lyft and Uber claim to reduce cost and minimize wait times for riders, based on each company's data-driven network advantage, as described in their annual reports?","[Chunk 1 — Uber 10-K excerpt]
Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, 
as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In more than 15,000 
cities around the world (as of December 31, 2024), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope 
eventually billions, of people. We leverage our scale and data to help reduce wait times, match supply and demand, and optimize 
pricing in real-time.

[Chunk 2 — Lyft 10-K excerpt]
We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of 
vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity 
related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. We leverage predictive technology and advanced dispatch algorithms 
to help reduce wait times and costs, matching riders with the nearest drivers in real-time.",Both companies highlight using (1) large-scale data analysis to match riders with nearby drivers quickly and (2) real-time optimization of pricing and dispatch to reduce costs and wait times.

Shopify focuses on a commerce platform for online presence, multichannel sales, and payment processing. Both aim to help entrepreneurs easily start and grow an online business."
"According to statements in Shopify's and GoDaddy's filings, which categories of merchants or organizations do they target, and what broad sets of products do they each offer?","[Chunk 1 — Shopify 10-K excerpt]
Our merchants represent a wide array of retail verticals and business sizes, and no single merchant has ever represented more than 
five percent of our total revenues in a single reporting period. We serve small and medium-sized businesses, direct-to-consumer

"Comparing Lyft and Uber, which company states it has three operating/reportable segments, and which company claims it has two segments, based on the references provided?","[Chunk 1 — Uber 10-K excerpt]
As of December 31, 2024, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and 
Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets. Mobility connects riders with drivers. Delivery spans food 
preparation and grocery delivery. Freight connects shippers and carriers. Our technology is available in over 70 countries around the 
world, principally in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific.

[Chunk 2 — Lyft 10-K excerpt]
We manage and report our business in the following two segments:
• Applications and Commerce (A&C), which primarily consists of sales of products containing proprietary software,
notably our website building products, as well as our proprietary commerce solutions and third-party email and
productivity solutions and sales of certain products when they are included in bundled offerings of our proprietary
software products.
• Core Platform (Core), which primarily consists of sales of domain registrations and renewals, aftermarket domain sales,
domain protection, website hosting products, etc.","Uber reports three segments (Mobility, Delivery, and Freight), while (based on the chunk text here) GoDaddy (incorrectly labeled as “Lyft 10-K excerpt” in the chunk) has two segments (Applications and Commerce, and Core Platform). The first chunk is Uber's, the second chunk is from GoDaddy, despite the labeling reference."
"From the disclosures of Uber and Shopify, describe how each company expects to address “autonomous vehicle technologies” or “autonomous” solutions. Summarize each company's stated approach in these references.","[Chunk 1 — Uber 10-K excerpt]
We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous 
vehicle technologies on our platform. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies present significant opportunities. Several 
companies are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete 
with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. We have formed partnerships to make sure our platform can offer rides in 
autonomous vehicles as well.

[Chunk 2 — Shopify 10-K excerpt]
Although our merchant-focused model means we do not directly build or invest in autonomous vehicle or drone technologies, we do 
observe the logistics sector closely, including novel means of delivery. While we do not currently offer autonomous delivery features, 
we remain open to partnerships if it aligns with merchant needs. Our focus remains on providing an integrated commerce platform 
rather than developing autonomy solutions.","Uber invests in partnerships and technology aimed at offering autonomous vehicle solutions on its platform, while Shopify does not directly build or fund autonomous vehicles but may partner for future merchant delivery needs."
"Consulting statements from Lyft and GoDaddy, which company more directly describes operating a “point-of-sale system” for in-person payments, and which offers “Smart Terminal” devices?","[Chunk 1 — Lyft 10-K excerpt]
We connect consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, 
public transit, taxis, and more—helping customers go almost anywhere. We believe our scale and global availability allows our 
Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences. We use marketplace technologies, routing, and payments to link drivers with riders. 

[Chunk 2 — GoDaddy 10-K excerpt]
We aim to lead the small business commerce market by enabling our customers to sell directly online, in-person and across multiple 
channels. Our suite of Commerce solutions includes GoDaddy Payments, point-of-sale systems that unify transaction management 
for in-person and online sales, and our Smart Terminal line of hardware with integrated payments. We continue to invest 
to deliver hardware solutions, including our flagship countertop Smart Terminal and our compact Smart Terminal Flex.",Lyft focuses on connecting drivers and riders via ridesharing and other transportation modes; it does not specifically describe point-of-sale systems or “Smart Terminal” devices. GoDaddy explicitly offers a POS system and a “Smart Terminal” hardware line for in-person payments.
"Which of these two companies (Shopify and Lyft) explicitly discusses “autonomous vehicle classification litigation” or “driver classification matters” in its disclosures, and which generally references assisting “merchants” with commerce?","[Chunk 1 — Shopify 10-K excerpt]
We develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and continue to expand the range of our products. Our focus is on 
merchant success. We are building products so merchants can more easily facilitate commerce across all channels, from online 
to physical retail, to social media. While we remain mindful of new and evolving markets, we generally do not develop 
autonomous driving solutions or driver classification programs.

[Chunk 2 — Lyft 10-K excerpt]
We have encountered litigation regarding driver classification and numerous legal proceedings globally, including claims that 
drivers should be treated as employees rather than as independent contractors. These matters could require us to alter our existing 
business model, pay significant costs or cease operations in affected jurisdictions. We also face competition from other 
transportation network companies and are subject to TNC regulations.",Lyft (in Chunk 2) explicitly mentions litigation over driver classification and potential changes to its business model. Shopify (in Chunk 1) focuses on assisting merchants with commerce and does not discuss “autonomous vehicle classification” or “driver classification.”
"According to statements in Shopify's and GoDaddy's filings, which company states a significant portion of its customer base is outside the U.S., and which references “pay parity” and “employee representation in Germany”?","[Chunk 1 — Shopify 10-K excerpt]
We had millions of merchants from more than 175 countries using our platform as of December 31, 2024, which were geographically 
dispersed as follows: 45% in the United States, 30% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 15% in Asia Pacific, Australia and China, 
5% in Canada and 5% in Latin America. We believe that the broad distribution of our merchants reflects the global appeal of 
our commerce solutions.

[Chunk 2 — GoDaddy 10-K excerpt]
Our people and unique culture have been integral to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we employed 5,518 people worldwide, 
with some employees in Germany represented by employee works councils. We published an annual diversity and pay parity report 
stating that, according to our analysis, we compensate employees of color and white employees substantially the same for performing
similar jobs across the company.","Shopify reports that a large share (roughly 55%) of its merchants is based outside the U.S., whereas GoDaddy references its pay parity practices and mentions having employees represented by works councils in Germany."
"Reviewing GoDaddy and Uber, which of these references hosting solutions “including cPanel, Plesk, Drupal, Joomla” favored by WebPros, and which references offering “Freight” for shippers and carriers?","[Chunk 1 — GoDaddy 10-K excerpt]
For more technically sophisticated WebPros and other customers, we provide hosting and security products using a variety of open-source 
design tools including cPanel, Plesk, Drupal, and Joomla. We also design these products to be easy to use, effective, reliable, flexible 
and at an excellent value.

[Chunk 2 — Uber 10-K excerpt]
We have three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery, and Freight. We believe Freight is revolutionizing the logistics
industry by connecting shippers and carriers in a digital marketplace. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network 
and connects Shippers and Carriers, giving Carriers upfront, transparent pricing.","GoDaddy (Chunk 1) references hosting with open-source tools (cPanel, Plesk, Drupal, Joomla). Uber (Chunk 2) references a “Freight” segment connecting shippers and carriers in a digital marketplace."
"Comparing Lyft and Shopify, which company states it is primarily involved in “ride services” across a network of drivers and references “non-autonomous vehicles,” and which is a platform focusing on “restaurants, grocery and retail categories for delivery”?","[Chunk 1 — Lyft 10-K excerpt]
Our offerings on the Lyft App include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of 
shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) for shorter rides. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders. 
We sometimes refer to riders as passengers who request rides from drivers in our Mobility segment.

and other retailers—and either pick it up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience 
and retail categories collectively as Grocery & Retail. Our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label 
Delivery-as-a-Service offering, as well as advertising opportunities.","Lyft is primarily engaged in ride services connecting drivers with riders and references bikes, scooters, and “non-autonomous vehicles.” Uber, in its “Delivery” segment, focuses on restaurants, grocery and retail categories, with pickup or local delivery."

to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and to expand the range of our offerings through research and development.
